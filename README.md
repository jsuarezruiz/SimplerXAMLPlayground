# SimplerXAMLPlayground

With the release of .NET 6, global and implicit using directives significantly reduced boilerplate in C# files. Now, starting in .NET 10 Preview 5, the same concept is being extended to XAML‚Äîallowing developers to define namespaces and prefixes in a single location and reuse them across the entire project.

This repository showcases a working sample of this new functionality, demonstrating how implicit and global XAML namespaces simplify UI development in .NET MAUI 10.
